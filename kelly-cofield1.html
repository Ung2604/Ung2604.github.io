<h1 align="center"><font color="orange">KELLY-COFIELD FAMILY REUNION</font></h1>
<br>
<h3>Held August 1, 2009 in Tallahassee Florida.</h3>

<h4><font color="GREEN">WOW!!!!!!!!,we did it,we had a family reunion. Their were family members who traveled from, Texas, Tennesse, North Carolina and various 
    parts of Florida, Tampa, Miami and Jacksonville.
    <br><br>
    I was so happy seeing so many family members that I have'nt seen for more than twenty years.
    I did'nt get a chance to personally meet and greet everyone as I would have like to, because I was so busy with the food, but I did have fun, 
    rain soaked and all. I even tried to dance...HaHa....Emma Jean, girlllllllll, you still got it.
    <br><br>
    Awesome family history, presented by, Julie and Honey and thank you Steve for the pictures, now I can recap the moments.
    <br><br>
    Thanks, for great turnout, especially to all the out-of-towners.  See you in 2011.
    <br><br>
    All My Love.
    <br>
